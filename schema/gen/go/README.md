=====

This package contains a codegenerator for emitting Golang source code
for datastructures based on IPLD Schemas.

It is at present a partially complete proof-of-concept.  Use at your own risk.

There is not yet a user-facing CLI; you have to write code to use it.

Check out the [HACKME](HACKME.md) document for more info about the internals,
how they're organized, and how to hack on this package.
