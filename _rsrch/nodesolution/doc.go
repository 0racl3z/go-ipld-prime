package ipld

/*
	This package accumulates some of the lessons learned from
	the 'style' experiment, the 'assembler' experiment, and a few others,
	while taking a strong stance on immediately returning errors.

	These choices don't maximize ergonomics, but they should maximize
	correctness and performance.  Ergonomics can come on top.
